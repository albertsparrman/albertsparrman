I'm a student at NTI gymnasiset Ume√• with a passion for webdevelopment and UX/UI design. I have experience with multiple different programming languages and web develpoment frameworks such as Angular and React. When I'm not programming I like to play and watch different sports, I also play video games and watch a good amount of movies. In the future I want to continue developing my programming skills and expand my knowledge on how you make good accessible designs.
